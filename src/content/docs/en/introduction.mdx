**Welcome to Quick.db!**

This npm package is designed as an open-source solution that offers a simple approach for developers to store and access data in a low to medium volume setting. The data is stored persistently utilizing either better-sqlite3 or promise-mysql and is supplemented by an array of other convenient quality-of-life features.

✅ **Persistent Storage** <br />
✅ **Multiple Drivers** <br />
✅ **Works out of the box** <br />
✅ **Beginner Friendly** <br />

## Installation

First, install the core package.

```md
npm install quick.db
```

You can choose either better-sqlite3 or promise-mysql as your driver. If you're not sure, you should use better-sqlite3.

### better-sqlite3

```js
const { QuickDB } = require("quick.db");
const db = new QuickDB();
```

### promise-mysql

```js
const { QuickDB, MySQLDriver } = require("quick.db");

(async () => {
    const mysql = new MySQLDriver({
        host: "localhost",
        user: "me",
        password: "secret",
        database: "my_db",
    });

    // Important: Connect to MySQL server before using it
    await mysql.connect();

    const db = new QuickDB({ driver: mysql });
})();
```
